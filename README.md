# Snyk-Kubernetes-reconciler
Stop-gap visibility while V3 of the enterprise monitor is not GA

This tool provides stop-gap visibility while the Snyk-Monitor V3 is not GA. This script uses, the K8s API to validate what is currently running in the cluster, then reaches out to Snyk via API to validate the difference between what is currently being scanned and what is not. Once this is done, it uploads (Via Snyk container monitor) container images to the UI, then proceeds to remove any images that are present within Snyk but not running on the cluster.

# Approach

The general idea is to query the Kubernetes API server (once), and validate what is running against the Snyk projects API by the name of the image. If the image name is not currently in Snyk, then it is added to a queue to be scanned along with the pods labels and annotations. Once a list of missing image objects has been created, we then run scan each image with the `snyk container monitor` command with relevant metadata. We make use of the `--project-name` flag to ensure that we can create individual projects per image tag/digest. After all images have been scanned, we then pull all images from the Snyk `container_images` endpoint, then check this against all of the projects within Snyk. Once we have that information, we check the `container_images` we have gathered against the running pods in the cluster, if that `container_image` from Snyk is not present in the list of running pods, we then attempt to delete the associated target within Snyk. 

# How to Deploy

To deploy the K8s reconciler, you will first need to create the relevant Role resources; within the K8s folder, there is a file roleResources.yaml which contains: A serviceAccount, ClusterRole, ClusterRoleBinding. The serviceAccount gets mounted into the pod and the cluster scope is needed to grab all pods. After you download the repo to your workstation, you will need to move your terminal to the root of the project and run all commands from there:

1. `docker build . -t YourImageName:YourImageTag`. This will build using the local Dockerfile and tag the image with the relevant name for your organization

2. `docker push YourImageName:YourImageTag`. This will push the image we just created to your repository to be pulled by the Cron Job/Job resource that we will deploy later.

3. After doing so, you will need to edit the `image` entry within the Job.yaml to point to the image that you pushed to your registry.

4. `kubectl create ns snyk-reconciler`. This creates a namespace so we can deploy our resources separated from the rest of the cluster.

5. `kubectl apply -f Kubernetes-Resources/roleResources.yaml -n snyk-reconciler`. These are the Kubernetes role resources needed to deploy, this requires cluster scope and the ability to list pods in all namespaces. If there is an issue deploying this file, you can apply them individually as well.

6. Once the Resources are created you will need to create a secret named `snyk-creds` in the namespace your job runs. If you require that the Reconciler pulls from private repositories, you can instead point the dockercfg.json at a config file that has credentials that can access all repositories. The following command can be used to generate the secret, there is no need to include the `Token` prefix for your APITOKEN:

```
kubectl create secret generic snyk-creds -n snyk-reconciler --from-file=dockercfg.json={} --from-literal=SNYK_CFG_ORG_ID={} --from-literal=SNYK_TOKEN={}
```

Currently, this is limited to basic authentication.

7. After creating your secret, you can run a job with `kubectl apply -f Kubernetes-resources/job.yaml`. If you are looking to do cadenced runs you can easily convert this to a cronjob (https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/)
